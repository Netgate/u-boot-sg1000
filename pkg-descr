U-Boot loader for the Netgate SG-1000.

This version is patched so that:
 * ELF and API features are enabled.
 * The default environment is trimmed to just what's needed to boot.
 * The DTB file name is chosen based on the board model and passed to ubldr
   using the fdtfile env variable.  ubldr loads the DTB from /boot/dtb/ on
   the FreeBSD partition.
 * By default, it loads ubldr from file ubldr.bin at offset 0xe0000 on SPI flash
   to address 0x88000000 and launches it.
